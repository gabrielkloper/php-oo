# PHP OO Study

This repository is a study project for learning Object Oriented Programming in PHP. It contains a series of classes and interfaces that illustrate the concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and interfaces.

## Project Structure

The project is structured in the following way:

- `classe-sem-construct.php`: This file contains the definition of a class without a constructor.
- `classe-com-construct.php`: This file contains the definition of a class with a constructor.
- `abstracao.php`: This file contains the definition of an abstract class and a derived class.
- `heranca.php`: This file contains the definition of a parent class and a child class.
- `polimorfismo.php`: This file contains the definition of a parent class and two child classes that demonstrate polymorphism.
- `interface.php`: This file contains the definition of an interface and a class that implements it.
- `index.php`: This file contains the main code for testing the classes and interfaces.

## Running the Code

To run the code, you need to have PHP installed on your machine. Then, you can open the `index.php` file in a web browser or run it from the command line using the `php` command.
